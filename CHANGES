- added Doxyfile
- send traces and errors to stderr
- changed PROBElist to (*PROBE)-list
- added tw
  - waves, measurements
  - step control
- added "math probes" (preliminary, stupid)
- allow inf as double value (hack), breaks i.* as variable name
   FIXME: use constant parameters (?)
- added ADP_CARD. not of any use.
- added sim commmand, time-as-parameter (hack?)
- added command history (incomplete)
- allow parameters as probe (HACK)
      ( almost: expressions like {a+v(foo)} )
- repaired sweep for batchmode. 
    uses parameters, breaks interactive mode sweep (?)
    also takes parameters.
    no nesting yet
- make output easier to parse for gnuplot (^* for non-data-lines)
- added options:
  - printrejected simplifies figuring out rejects.
  - some tolarance values (tt)
  - new option includepath (colon separated)
- load/attach makes use of includepath
- powerof from gnucap-a merged
- fixed measurements to return double (not string)
   ( if strings are needed, templates should be used ?)
- fixed OMSTREAM to support multiple files. (used in tt)
- .echo command
- read $PWD/.gnucaprc on startup (otherwise read ~/.gnucaprc)
- rudimentary .vdump .vload support
- propagate error ( return from main )
- switched to automake dependencies (good idea? might break modelgen stuff)
